ðŸŒŸ Welcome to my data science journey at Oasis Infobyte! ðŸŒŸ

Welcome, This repository comprises Jupyter notebooks, datasets meticulously curated to showcase the breadth and depth of my contributions to various projects.

During my internship, I tackled diverse data science tasks, including thorough data analysis, advanced machine learning, and impactful data visualizations. Each item in this repository reflects my careful problem-solving and dedication to producing reliable solutions.

This internship allowed me to gain practical experience in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. By exploring these materials, you'll understand how I approached tasks, what strategies I employed, and the concrete results I attained during my internship.

## Tools/Skills Used:
* Programming Language - Python
* Data Analysis and Visualization: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib,Seaborn.
* Machine Learning - sklearn
* Natural Language Processing - nltk
  
## Task List 
Here's an overview of the tasks and projects I worked on during my internship:

## 1. IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION:
A classic machine learning project to classify iris flowers based on their features. In this poject I utilized KNearestNeighbours Classifier with an accuracy of 100% to classify iris flowers.

## 2. Unemployment Analysis During Covid - 19
This project involved the analysis of unemployment rate during covid-19.Generated insights by utilizing plotly and seaborn libraries. 

## 3. Car Price Prediction
This project Employed various regressor models including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and MLP Regressor for car price prediction.MLP Regressor exhibited superior performance with an accuracy of 95%.

## 4. Email Detection with Machine Learning
In this project utilized the concepts of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to identify the mail as spam or ham. In this I used Logistic Regression, LinearSVC, Random Forest Classifier and XGBClassifier in which LinearSVC got the highest accuracy of 98%.

## 5. Sales Prediction using Python
In this project I have to predict the sales price means how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise, segment of people or the platform you advertise using python for which I have used the regressor models - Linear Regression model and Random Forest Regressor for predicting the sales. The Random Forest Regressor has performed well with the accuracy of 98%.
